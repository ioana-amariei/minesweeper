### Description
This game was developed as a requirement for a school project.
The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a 
square with a mine underneath. The location of the mines is discovered using clues as a deductive method. 


### Functionalities
* Random mines generator, with a limit of bombs;
* Option to mark a particular square with a flag;
* Reveal all adjacent squares, if no mines are adjacent.
